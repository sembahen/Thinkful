Write a query that returns the namefirst and namelast fields of the people table, 
along with the inducted field from the hof_inducted table. All rows from the people 
table should be returned, and NULL values for the fields from hof_inducted should be 
returned when there is no match found.

SELECT people.namefirst, people.namelast, hof_inducted.inducted
FROM people FULL OUTER JOIN hof_inducted
ON people.playerid=hof_inducted.playerid;

In 2006, a special Baseball Hall of Fame induction was conducted for players from the 
negro baseball leagues of the 20th century. In that induction, 17 players were posthumously 
inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Write a query that returns the first and last names, 
birth and death dates, and birth countries for these players. Note that the year of induction was 2006,
 and the value for votedby will be “Negro League.”

SELECT namefirst, namelast, birthyear, deathyear,birthcountry
FROM people LEFT OUTER JOIN hof_inducted
ON people.playerid=hof_inducted.playerid
WHERE hof_inducted.yearid=2006
AND hof_inducted.votedby='Negro League'

4.Write a query that returns the yearid, playerid, teamid, and salary fields from the salaries table, 
along with the category field from the hof_inducted table. Keep only the records that are in both salaries
 and hof_inducted. Hint: While a field named yearid is found in both tables, don’t JOIN by it. You must, 
however, explicitly name which field to include.

SELECT salaries.yearid, salaries.playerid,salaries.teamid, salaries.salary, hof_inducted.category
FROM salaries INNER JOIN hof_inducted
ON salaries.playerid=hof_inducted.playerid;

5.Write a query that returns the playerid, yearid, teamid, lgid, and salary fields from the salaries 
table and the inducted field from the hof_inducted table. Keep all records from both tables.
SELECT salaries.playerid, salaries.yearid, salaries.teamid, salaries.lgid, salaries.salary, hof_inducted.inducted

6. There are 2 tables, hof_inducted and hof_not_inducted, indicating successful and unsuccessful inductions
into the Baseball Hall of Fame, respectively.
1. Combine these 2 tables by all fields. Keep all records.

SELECT hof_inducted.*, hof_not_inducted.*
FROM hof_inducted FULL OUTER JOIN hof_not_inducted
ON hof_inducted.playerid=hof_not_inducted.playerid;

2. Get a distinct list of all player IDs for players who have been put up for HOF induction.
